Algorithm Problem 1: 
Implement an algorithm for determining if N is a divisor of a M (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6)
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

[We will use the modulus/remainder (%) operator which yields a remainder when the first operand is divided by the second]

1. Start by inputting values of M and N

2. Check if N is a divisor of M
       N is a divisor of M only if M % N == 0

3. If N is a divisor of M, determine if N is even or odd
       N is even if N % 2 == 0 
       N is odd if N % 2 != 0
