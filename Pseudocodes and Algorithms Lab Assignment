Algorithm Problem 1: 
Implement an algorithm for determining if N is a divisor of a M (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6)
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

[We will use the modulus/remainder (%) operator which yields a remainder when the first operand is divided by the second]

1. Start by inputting values of M and N
2. Check if N is a divisor of M
       N is a divisor of M only if M % N == 0
3. If N is a divisor of M, determine if N is even or odd
       N is even if N % 2 == 0 
       N is odd if N % 2 != 0



Algorithm Problem 2:
Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.

[We will set the months of the year to their corresponding numbers from 1 to 12 for e.g. January = 1, February = 2.....November = 11, Deceember = 12]

1. Start by asking the user for a number from 1 to 12
2. If the number is within that range, display the month corresponding to it
3. If the number is outiside of that range, display an error message "Invalid number! Please enter a number between 1 and 12."


Algorithm Problem 3:
Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)


1. Start by asking the user to input num1 and num2
2. Next ask the user for an operator (+,-,*,/,%)
       - If operator is == '+' then result = num1 + num2
       - Else if operator == '-' then result = num1 - num2
       - Else if operator = '*' then result = num1 * num2
       - Else if operator = '/' then
              - if num2 != 0 then result = num1 / num2
              - else if num2 == 0 display an error message "Division by zero is not allowed!"
       - Else if operator = '%' then
              - if num2 !=  0 then result = num1 % num2 
              - else if num2 == 0 display an error message "Division by zero is not allowed!"
       - Else if the user inputs an operator not amongst the ones listed above, display an error message "Operator is incorrect"
3. Print result
