Algorithm Problem 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if N is a divisor of a M (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6) If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.


[We will use the modulus/remainder (%) operator which yields a remainder when the first operand is divided by the second]

1. Start by inputting values of M and N
2. Check if N is a divisor of M
       N is a divisor of M only if M % N == 0
3. If N is a divisor of M, determine if N is even or odd
       N is even if N % 2 == 0 
       N is odd if N % 2 != 0



Algorithm Problem 2: Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.


[We will set the months of the year to their corresponding numbers from 1 to 12 for e.g. January = 1, February = 2.....November = 11, Deceember = 12]

1. Start by asking the user for a number from 1 to 12
2. If the number is within that range, display the month corresponding to it
3. If the number is outiside of that range, display an error message "Invalid number! Please enter a number between 1 and 12."



Algorithm Problem 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)


1. Start by asking the user to input num1 and num2
2. Next ask the user for an operator (+,-,*,/,%)
       - If operator is == '+' then result = num1 + num2
       - Else if operator == '-' then result = num1 - num2
       - Else if operator = '*' then result = num1 * num2
       - Else if operator = '/' then
              - if num2 != 0 then result = num1 / num2
              - else if num2 == 0 display an error message "Division by zero is not allowed!"
       - Else if operator = '%' then
              - if num2 !=  0 then result = num1 % num2 
              - else if num2 == 0 display an error message "Division by zero is not allowed!"
       - Else if the user inputs an operator not amongst the ones listed above, display an error message "Operator is incorrect"
3. Print result 



Psuedocode Problem 1: Find the maximum number in any of three variables

1. START
2. INPUT A, B, C
3. IF A >= B AND A >= C THEN
       maximum = A
   ELSE IF B >= A AND B >= C THEN
       maximum = B
   ELSE
       maximum = C
4. PRINT maximum
5. STOP



Pseudocode Problem 2: Take three variables as input and add them without using the '+' operator

1. START
2. INPUT A,B,C
3. SET
       result = 0
4. result = A * -1
5. result = result - B
6. result = result - C
7. result = result * -1
8. PRINT result
9. STOP


       
Pseudocode Problem 3: Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)

1. START
2. Input num1, op, num2
3. IF op == '+' THEN 
       result = num1 + num2
   ELSE IF op == '-' THEN
       result = num1 - num2
   ELSE
       PRINT "Invalid operator! Please use '+' or '-'"
4. STOP
